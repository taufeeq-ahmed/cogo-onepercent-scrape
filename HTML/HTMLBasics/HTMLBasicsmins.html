This section will teach you the basics of HTML and CSS, the two foundational building blocks of pretty much everything on the web.</p></div><h2>Lesson Overview</h2><div class="content"><p>This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.</p><ul>
    <li>Get a basic overview of HTML, CSS and how they work together.</li>
  </ul></div><h2>HTML and CSS</h2><div class="content"><p>HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet. HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. CSS is what adds <em>style</em> to those plain elements. HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!</p><p>Many great resources out there keep referring to HTML and CSS as <em>programming languages</em>, but if you want to get technical, labeling them as such is not quite accurate, because they are only concerned with presenting information. They are not used to program any logic. JavaScript, which you will be learning in the next section, is a programming language because it's used to make webpages do things. Yet, there is quite a lot you can do with just HTML and CSS, and you will definitely need them both. The following lessons focus on giving you the tools you need to be successful once you get to the JavaScript content as you continue through our curriculum!</p></div><h2>Assignment</h2><div class="content"><div class="lesson-content__panel">
