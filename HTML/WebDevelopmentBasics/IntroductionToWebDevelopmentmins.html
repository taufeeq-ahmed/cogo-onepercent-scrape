<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>What do web developers do? In short, they build and maintain websites.</p>
  <p>
    Web developers often work for clients who are trying to get their product or
    service onto the web. The work is typically very project focused and
    involves collaborating with a team that helps to coordinate the client's
    needs into the end product. The client could be a tech company, an
    organization, or a government. The work could involve front-end, back-end,
    or full-stack web development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web development could be a good profession for you if you like solving
    logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new
    technologies. Web developers are in high demand, generally have a good
    work/life balance, and command comfortable salaries. Google your specific
    location to get a better sense of your local web development job
    opportunities.

    profession in their

<h2>Types of Web Developers</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Earlier, we mentioned that web development work could be in the front end,
    the back end, or the full stack. What exactly do these terms mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>front end</strong> is the stuff you see on the website in your
    browser, including the presentation of content and user interface elements
    like the navigation bar. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
    their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively
    and that users have an excellent experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>back end</strong> refers to the guts of the application, which
    live on the server. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure
    that the front end has what it needs. This process can become very
    complicated when a website has millions of users. Back-end developers use
    programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to work with
    data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Full-stack developers</strong> are comfortable working with both the
    front and back ends. At The Odin Project, we focus on teaching you
    full-stack development, covering all aspects of web development.

<h2>Types of Careers</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Now that you know about the different types of web developers, let's cover
    what we mentioned earlier about the different types of clients and employers
    you may work with.
  </p>
  <p>
    Large tech companies, such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, have very stringent
    hiring requirements. If you successfully meet these expectations, they offer
    excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Startups are a bit like the wild west. For a junior developer, it can feel
    like a trial by fire because of the pace of development. Startups often
    offer slightly lower salaries and require longer hours, but they may also
    offer equity in the company and highly unique environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a freelancer, you could command a strong hourly wage and the freedom to
    schedule and design your own products. However, you would be responsible for
    getting your own work (which means less coding time), managing billing from
    clients (which can be difficult), and being solely responsible. Strong
    people skills are necessary for this path.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a consultant for a web consultancy, you would give up some of your
    freelancing wage potential but be able to focus more on the code and less on
    the hustle. This option also provides a good work/life balance and pay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, large, older companies still need web developers. These companies
    offer a good work/life balance, pay, and benefits but often move slower than
    a company that is highly focused on tech.
  </p>

<h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    These are some of the basic tools you will use regularly. You may not know
    what they are now, but you most certainly will going forward.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computer</strong></li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Text Editor</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong></li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and
    frustrating. The strongest assets you can have as a student are a desire to
    build, a problem-solving mind, and persistence in the face of setbacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The web development industry has a long history of successful developers
    with varying backgrounds, so people tend to care more about what you've
    actually <strong>built</strong> than how you got there.
