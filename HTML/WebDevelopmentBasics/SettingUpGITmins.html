    <h4 id="step-11-update-the-system">Step 1.1: Update the system</h4>

    <p>Run these commands in the terminal to update the Linux system:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <h4 id="step-12-install-git">Step 1.2: Install git</h4>

    <p>You likely have <code>git</code> installed already, but to make sure that we have the most up to date version of git, run the following commands:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <h4 id="step-13-verify-version">Step 1.3: Verify version</h4>

    <p>Make sure your git version is <strong>at least</strong> 2.28 by running this command:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git --version
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>If the version number is less than 2.28, follow the instructions again.</p>

    <h4 id="step-10-install-homebrew">Step 1.0: Install Homebrew</h4>

    <p>First, you'll need to install Homebrew.  Make sure you have checked the requirements <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#macos-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Once you meet the requirements, copy and paste the following into your terminal:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> On an Apple Silicon Mac you will have an extra step to take.
If you look at the terminal output after installing Homebrew, you will see 'Installation Successful!'. Further down in the terminal there will be a section called 'Next steps'. 
Reading the terminal may seem a bit intimidating, but this is a great chance to overcome those feelings. Follow the next steps as stated in your terminal (copy and paste the commands given) to add Homebrew to your PATH, which allows you to use the <code>brew</code> command prefix.</p>

    <h4 id="step-11-update-git">Step 1.1: Update Git</h4>

    <p>MacOS already comes with a version of Git, but you should update to the latest version. In the terminal, type</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">brew install git
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>This will install the latest version of Git. Easy, right?</p>

    <h4 id="step-12-verify-version">Step 1.2: Verify version</h4>

    <p>If you have just installed and/or updated Git from the previous step, first close that terminal window.</p>

    <p><strong>Open a new terminal window</strong> and then make sure your git version is <strong>at least</strong> 2.28 by running this command:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git --version
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>If the version number is less than 2.28, follow the instructions again. If you are encountering a <code>no formulae found in taps</code> error:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Run <code>brew doctor</code></li>
      <li>You will see an output like the one below. NOTE: The actual output of <code>brew doctor</code> may vary based on the version of MacOS you're running, and any other issues you may have with your own installation. Ultimately, you must run each command line snippet that Homebrew provides after running <code>brew doctor</code> to repair your installation of Homebrew, including <code>brew cleanup</code> at the end.

    <p>You will need to install Git from the source by following the instructions from this <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-debian-10#installing-git-from-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Ocean tutorial</a>.</p>

  </details></div><h2>Step 2: Configure Git and GitHub</h2><div class="content"><h4 id="step-21-create-a-github-account">Step 2.1: Create a GitHub Account</h4><p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub.com</a> and create an account! During the account setup, it will ask you for an email address. This needs to be a real email, and will be used by default to identify your contributions. If you are privacy conscious, or just don't want your email address to be publicly available, make sure you tick the following two boxes on the <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email Settings</a> page after you have signed in:</p><p><a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/770be14190139683dbe9933ca5e9393c797c63f2/foundations/installations/setting_up_git/imgs/01.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/770be14190139683dbe9933ca5e9393c797c63f2/foundations/installations/setting_up_git/imgs/01.png" alt="GitHub Email Settings"></a></p><p>Having these two options enabled will prevent you accidentally exposing your personal email address when working with Git and GitHub.</p><p>You may also notice an email address under the <strong>Keep my email addresses private</strong> option, this is your private GitHub email address. If you plan to use this, make note of it now as you will need it when setting up Git in the next step.</p><h4 id="step-22-setup-git">Step 2.2: Setup Git</h4><p>For Git to work properly, we need to let it know who we are so that it can link a local Git user (you) to GitHub. When working on a team, this allows people to see what you have committed and who committed each line of code.</p><p>The commands below will configure Git. Be sure to enter your own information inside the quotes (but include the quotation marks)!</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>If you opted to use the private GitHub email address, the second command will look something like this:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git config --global user.email "123456789+odin@users.noreply.github.com" # Remember to use your own private GitHub email here.
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>GitHub recently changed the default branch on new repositories from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code>. Change the default branch for Git using this command:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git config --global init.defaultBranch main
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>To enable colorful output with <code>git</code>, type</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git config --global color.ui auto
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>You'll also likely want to set your default branch reconciliation behavior to merging. You'll learn what all those terms mean later in the curriculum, but for now just know that we suggest running the below command as part of the Git setup process when doing The Odin Project.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git config --global pull.rebase false
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>To verify that things are working properly, enter these commands and verify whether the output matches your name and email address.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p><strong>macOS Users:</strong> Run these two commands to tell git to ignore .DS_Store files, which are automatically created when you use Finder to look into a folder. .DS_Store files are invisible to the user and hold custom attributes or metadata (like thumbnails) for the folder, and if you don't configure Git to ignore them, pesky .DS_Store files will show up in your commits.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">echo .DS_Store &gt;&gt; ~/.gitignore_global

<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><h4 id="step-23-create-an-ssh-key">Step 2.3: Create an SSH Key</h4><p>An SSH key is a cryptographically secure identifier. It's like a really long password used to identify your machine. GitHub uses SSH keys to allow you to upload to your repository without having to type in your username and password every time.</p><p>First, we need to see if you have an Ed25519 algorithm SSH key already installed. Type this into the terminal and check the output with the information below:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>If a message appears in the console containing the text 'No such file or directory', then you do not yet have an Ed25519 SSH key, and you will need to create one. If no such message has appeared in the console output, you can proceed to step 2.4.</p><p>To create a new SSH key, run the following command inside your terminal. The <code>-C</code> flag followed by your email address ensures that GitHub knows who you are.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The angle brackets (<code>&lt; &gt;</code>) in the code snippet below indicate that you should replace that part of the command with the appropriate information. Do not include the brackets themselves in your command. For example, if your email address is <code>odin@theodinproject.com</code>, then you would type <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C odin@theodinproject.com</code>. You will see this convention of using angle brackets to indicate placeholder text used throughout The Odin Project's curriculum and other coding websites, so it's good to be familiar with what it means.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &lt;youremail&gt;
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><ul>
    <li>When it prompts you for a location to save the generated key, just push <code>Enter</code>.</li>
    <li>Next, it will ask you for a password; enter one if you wish, but it's not required.</li>
  </ul><h4 id="step-24-link-your-ssh-key-with-github">Step 2.4: Link Your SSH Key with GitHub</h4><p>Now, you need to tell GitHub what your SSH key is so that you can push your code without typing in a password every time.</p><p>First, you'll navigate to where GitHub receives our SSH key. Log into GitHub and click on your profile picture in the top right corner. Then, click on <code>Settings</code> in the drop-down menu.</p><p>Next, on the left-hand side, click <code>SSH and GPG keys</code>. Then, click the green button in the top right corner that says <code>New SSH Key</code>. Name your key something that is descriptive enough for you to remember where it came from. Leave this window open while you do the next steps.</p><p>Now you need to copy your public SSH key. To do this, we're going to use a command called <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cat</code></a> to read the file to the console. (Note that the <code>.pub</code> file extension is important in this case.)</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Highlight and copy the output, which starts with <code>ssh-ed25519</code> and ends with your email address.</p><p>Now, go back to GitHub in your browser window and paste the key you copied into the key field. Then, click <code>Add SSH key</code>. You're done! You've successfully added your SSH key!</p><h4 id="step-25-testing-your-key">Step 2.5 Testing your key</h4><p>Follow the directions in <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article from GitHub</a> to verify your SSH connection <strong>(Don't forget to omit the <code>$</code> when you copy and paste the code!)</strong>. You should see this response in your terminal: <strong>Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.</strong> Don't let GitHub's lack of providing shell access trouble you. If you see this message, you've successfully added your SSH key and you can move on. If the output doesn't correctly match up, then try going through these steps again or come to <a href="https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Discord chat</a> to ask for help.</p></div><h2>Step 3: Let us know how it went!</h2><div class="content"><p>You've completed the basic installations section, good job!
